# Minesweeper
Remake of Minesweeper using Lua with LÖVE as it's framework
More about the [game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game))

## Getting Started

In order to run the game, LÖVE, a framework used to make 2D games in Lua has to be installed into your system by following the [link](https://love2d.org/).

During installation, be sure to create a desktop icon as this will make it easier to run LÖVE games.

## Running the game

The game can be run by dragging the folder containing the game into the LÖVE desktop icon.
It can also be run by using the `love` bash command, for example:
```
love <name_of_directory>
```

Note: the directory must contain the **main.lua** file

## Built With

* [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) - The game framework used
